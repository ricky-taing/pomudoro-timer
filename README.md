# Pomudoro "Rainpuff" Timer

Fully customizable Pomodoro Timer based on Pomu Rainpuff. Don't like the theme? Change the background color, background image and sounds or add your own. 

## Why

In order to honor Pomu Rainpuff who has now graduated from Nijisanji as of January 2024 and build a timer that users can make their own. The original idea came from Pomu and Pomodoro sounding similar.

## Quick Start

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your machine. This project was
built against the following versions:

Node v13.13.0
npm v6.14.5

Clone this repository to your local machine with:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ricky-taing/pomudoro-timer.git
```

## Usage

The timer features three different modes: Pomudoro, Short Break and Long Break which are 25, 5 and 15 minutes by default. The user can change how long each session or break is through the Settings Menu.
